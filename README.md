Course project: Python program simulating a salad order system using object-oriented design and a MinHeap structure

File Descriptions
- Salad.py: Defines the base 'Salad' class with size and price attributes.
- CustomSalad.py: Inherits from 'Salad' and allows customizable toppings. Price is calculated based on size and toppings.
- SpecialtySalad.py: Inherits from 'Salad' and represents salad types with fixed prices.
- SaladOrder.py: Represents a customer's full order (a list of salads) with a specified pickup time.
- OrderQueue.py: Implements a MinHeap to process orders in ascending order of pickup time.
- testFile.py: Contains unit tests to verify behavior and logic of the classes.

This project was completed as a course assignment to demonstrate classes, inheritance, and data structure implementation using Python.
